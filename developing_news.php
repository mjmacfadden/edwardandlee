            <h4>New Case Law And The Impact On Insureds</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Law Enforcement Liability insurance includes coverage for a wide variety of risks.  The single biggest developing area of case law is that of exonerated inmates.  These wrongfully convicted citizens are creating settlements in jurisdictions across the country and in ever growing numbers.  There is no end in sight to the vast number of people who will be eligible for claims in the near future.</p>
            <p>The impact on the insured is obvious on the face of it, the insured will be facing higher premiums when they have a claim for a wrongful conviction.  However, more importantly, those who are in a risk sharing pool face additional exposure as their coverage can be exhausted by another member of the pool.  Below are examples of the size of claims that are being paid out for wrongful convictions, these can easily drain a poolâ€™s limits of liability.  This would leave other members of the pool bare, without coverage for even the most basic Law Enforcement Liability coverage. </p>
